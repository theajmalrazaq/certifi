# CertEdit



Welcome to CertEdit, the only certificate generator you'll ever need because, let's face it, who has time to handwrite names on certificates? Not you, that's for sure. CertEdit is a gloriously simple web app built with good old vanilla JavaScript and HTML, because why make things easy when you can do it the hard way?

## Features

- Generate multiple certificates at once, because doing them one by one is for chumps.
- A user interface so intuitive, even your pet goldfish could use it.
- Upload your name list in CSV or TXT format. Spreadsheets not your thing? Tough luck.
- Upload a certificate template in image form. Yes, an actual image. Don't ask why.
- Select custom colors and fonts for the names. Pretend you're a designer.
- No external libraries. We like to keep things pure and painful.

## Installation

To start your journey into the world of certificate generation, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. We hope you like command lines.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theajmalrazaq/certedit.git
cd certedit
```

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Upload a name list in CSV or TXT format. Yes, another file.
3. Upload a certificate template in image form. Because why not?
4. Select custom colors and fonts for the names. Go wild.
5. Click the "Generate Certificates" button and feel the power.
6. Download the generated certificates. Show them off to your friends.

## Example

Here's a quick example, because we know you're too busy to figure it out yourself:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Upload a CSV or TXT file with names like `John Doe, Jane Smith, Alice Johnson`. Try to spell them right.
3. Upload a certificate template image. Any image will do, probably.
4. Choose your desired color and font for the names. Make it pretty.
5. Click "Generate Certificates". Try not to break anything.
6. Certificates for John Doe, Jane Smith, and Alice Johnson will be generated and available for download. Hooray!

This version should add a bit of humor and sarcasm while still conveying all the necessary information. If you want any more tweaks or further customization, just let me know!
